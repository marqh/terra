Terra: With Respect To That
===========================

Terra is a Python library supporting the statement that a Subject is defined with respect to a Coordinate Reference System.  The nature of these subject is outside of the scope of terra, anything may be defined with respect to a Terra Coordinate Reference System.

This pattern is commonly used to define location with respect to a known body, such as the Earth.

Terra provides parsing and serialisations of certain encodings of Coordinate Reference Systems.
