Terra: with respect to that
===========================

Terra is a Python library supporting the statement that a 
`Subject is defined with respect to a Coordinate Reference System`  

Coordinate reference systems may be defined with Terra, terra imposes no constraints on what may be defined with respect to a Terra Coordinate Reference System.

This pattern is commonly used to define location with respect to a known body, such as the Earth.

Terra provides representations, parsing and serialisations of certain Coordinate Reference Systems and encodings.
